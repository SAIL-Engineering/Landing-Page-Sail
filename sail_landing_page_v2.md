## THE PROBLEM SECTION

### Section Label: THE REALITY

### Headline:

# Your compliance data is already out of date.

### Body:

Most trade compliance teams are running on spreadsheets last touched six months ago. When tariffs shift—and they shift constantly—someone has to manually review thousands of product classifications. That someone is usually already behind.

**The math doesn't work:**

- Average enterprise product catalog: **15,000+ SKUs**
- Annual HTS schedule changes: **2,000+ modifications**
- Time to manually re-classify one product: **45 minutes**
- Full catalog review: **Never actually completed**

SAIL monitors regulatory changes and automatically flags affected products. Your catalog stays current. Your team stays focused on exceptions, not maintenance.

## HOW IT WORKS SECTION

### Section Label: HOW IT WORKS

### Headline:

# From chaos to cleared. Continuously.

---

this needs to commnicated in a way that doesnt require a shit ton of scrolls, maybe a scrollable container ? up to you

### STEP 01: Classify

**Headline:** Get the code right the first time.

**Body:**
Classification confidence scores with full reasoning chains. See exactly why a product maps to a specific HTS code—not just the answer, but the legal logic behind it.

**UI Card:**

```
HTS Classification                           98% Confidence

Industrial Sensor Array                      8542.31.00.00
├─ Chapter 85: Electrical machinery
├─ Heading 8542: Electronic integrated circuits
├─ Subheading 8542.31: Processors and controllers
└─ Statistical suffix: .00.00

Evidence: Product spec (p.12), Material composition (p.3)
```

---

### STEP 02: Monitor

**Headline:** Know when regulations change before they hit.

**Body:**
SAIL tracks HTS schedule updates, Section 301/232 modifications, IEPA changes, and Chapter 99 provisions. When something affects your catalog, you know immediately—not after the audit.

**UI Card:**

```
Regulatory Alert                             2 hours ago

Section 301 List Update — Effective Jan 15, 2026
47 products in your catalog affected

HTS 8471.50 → Rate change: 25% → 35%
HTS 8542.31 → New exclusion available

[Review affected products →]
```

---

### STEP 03: Maintain

**Headline:** Keep 10,000 products current without 10,000 hours.

**Body:**
Continuous compliance monitoring across your entire product catalog. Stale classifications surface automatically. Re-classification runs in the background. Your team reviews and approves—SAIL does the rest.

**UI Card:**

```
Catalog Health                               Last scan: 12m ago

[View flagged items →]
```

---

### STEP 04: Defend

**Headline:** Audit-ready documentation, always.

**Body:**
Every classification includes the evidence chain: product specs, material composition, legal reasoning, and approval history. When CBP sends a CF-28, you respond in hours—not weeks.

**UI Card:**

```
CF-28 Response Packet                        Ready to export

Product: Industrial Sensor Array (GTX-8542-31)

## CASE STUDY SECTION

### Section Label: CASE STUDY

### Headline:

# How Invista transformed trade compliance operations.

### Subhead:

From reactive firefighting to continuous confidence.

---

**The Challenge:**
Invista's trade compliance team managed 8,000+ product classifications across multiple business units. Every tariff change meant weeks of manual review. CF-28 responses took 3-4 weeks to compile. The team spent more time on maintenance than strategy.

**The Approach:**
SAIL GTX deployed in 11 days. Full product catalog imported. Classification confidence scores generated. Continuous monitoring activated.

**The Results:**

| Metric                                | Before SAIL       | After SAIL           |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Time to classify new product          | 45 minutes        | 3 minutes            |
| CF-28 response time                   | 3-4 weeks         | Same day             |
| Products reviewed after tariff change | ~15% (sampled)    | 100% (automated)     |
| Classification confidence             | Unknown           | 98.2% verified       |
| Catalog currency                      | Updated quarterly | Updated continuously |

**Quote:**

> "We used to dread tariff changes. Now SAIL flags exactly what's affected and generates the re-classification analysis automatically. We just review and approve. Our team finally has time for strategic work."

**Timeline:**

- **Day 3:** Classification engine calibrated to your products
- **Day 7:** Full regulatory monitoring active

# MESSAGING FRAMEWORK SUMMARY

## Core Positioning

**SAIL GTX: Trade compliance that keeps up with the world.**

## Key Differentiators vs. Altana

| Altana                               | SAIL                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 6-12 month implementation            | Live in days/weeks             |
| Enterprise-only pricing              | Serves entire ecosystem        |
| Network/value chain focus            | Productivity/accuracy focus    |
| Data platform play                   | Workflow tool play             |
| Government collaboration positioning | Practitioner-first positioning |

## Primary Value Props (in order)

1. **Always Current:** Continuous regulatory monitoring, automatic stale detection
2. **Speed to Classify:** Minutes not hours per product
3. **Audit-Ready:** CF-28 response in hours, not weeks
4. **Full Catalog Coverage:** 100% review after changes, not sampling
5. **Fast Deployment:** Days/weeks, not months

## Avoid in Messaging

- "AI-powered" (table stakes, everyone says it)
- Dollar-focused ROI claims (unless we have real data)
- Value chain / supply chain visibility language (Altana's territory)
- UFLPA / forced labor compliance (not our focus)
- Government partnership positioning (not our play)

## Emphasize in Messaging

- Real-time / always current / never stale
- Speed (to classify, to respond, to deploy)
- Accuracy with evidence (confidence scores + reasoning chains)
- Audit defense / legal defensibility
- Productivity / workflow efficiency
- Universal ecosystem fit (brokers + enterprise + advisory + legal)
- Product catalog management (the central source of truth)

## Harvey Parallel

Just as Harvey gave lawyers document analysis, contract review, and research acceleration—SAIL gives trade compliance professionals classification analysis, regulatory monitoring, and audit preparation acceleration. The jobs to be done are similar: take complex regulatory/legal work and make experts 10x more productive.
